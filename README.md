# Sign Language Recognition & Voice-Based Mail System

In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects hand gestures that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other
signs and hand gestures including the alphabets,numbers .

We have developed this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.

Prerequisites
The prerequisites software & libraries for the sign language project are:

- Python (3.7.4)

- IDE (Jupyter)

- Numpy (version 1.16.5)

- cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)

- Keras (version 2.3.1)

- Tensorflow (as keras uses tensorflow in backend and for image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)


A basic GUI was designed Using Python Tkinter  which looks like
